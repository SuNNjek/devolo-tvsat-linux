*** INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ***

The included Makefiles and init scripts were developed with Ubuntu 8.04 and
8.10 in mind. The Makefiles are designed to provide an easy-to-use means of
building and installing the driver from source code. They should be able to
locate kernel sources and init tools by themselves, at least on the
aforementioned Linux systems.


You need to have a working build environment for building kernel modules in
order to compile and install this driver package. If you do not have such
an environment, try the following methods of setting one up:

** Ubuntu 8.04 **
- install the package 'build-essential'
- install the kernel headers package for your currently running kernel
  (usually 'linux-headers-generic')

** Ubuntu 8.10 **
- install the package 'build-essential'
- install the kernel headers package for your currently running kernel
  (usually 'linux-headers-generic')
- install the kernel source package for your currently running kernel
  ('linux-source')
- open a command shell and get root access
- go to the '/usr/src' directory and unpack the linux-source package
    e.g. 'cd /usr/src; tar xjf linux-source-2.6.27.tar.bz2'
- create a symbolic link from the 'drivers' directory in your linux sources
  to your linux headers
    e.g. 'ln -sfn /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.27/drivers /usr/src/linux-headers-`uname -r`/drivers'
- let the '/usr/src/linux' link point to your linux headers
    e.g. 'ln -sfn /usr/src/linux-headers-`uname -r` /usr/src/linux'


Once you have a working build environment, just do the following:

- open a command shell and get root access
- go to the directory where you found this instructions file
- run 'make' and then 'make install'
- either reboot linux or execute the following commands:
	modprobe tvsat
	/etc/init.d/tvsatd start
- install a DVB viewer (Kaffeine, VDR, MythTV, etc.)
- make sure your user has the necessary rights to watch tv (e.g. on Ubuntu
  you have to be in the 'video' group)


If you have not already configured your TV Sat's IP settings, you can do so
by using the 'tvsatcfg' configuration tool. Type 'man tvsatcfg' for more
information on how to use it. Be sure to close all DVB viewers before using the
configuration tool.


The tvsat daemon has a configuration file that will be installed to
/etc/tvsat/tvsatd.conf. There are two options that can be changed:

broadcast_interval:     The interval in seconds between the broadcasts that
                        are sent out by the daemon to find TV Sat devices.
                        Valid values are in the range [5..999].
interface:      The network interface that the daemon should bind to. Only
                one interface may be specified here. If you remove this
                option, the daemon broadcasts on all interfaces. This is
                the default behavior.

The file also includes a device map, that lets you map an IP or MAC address
to a DVB adapter. Refer to the examples in the file for the exact notation.
This map is especially useful in scenarios where two or more TV Sat devices
are used to receive signals from different satellites. This way you can
make satellite equipment settings per DVB adapter without having to worry
about them switching adapter numbers when you reboot your computer.
